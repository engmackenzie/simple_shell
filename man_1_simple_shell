.SH SYNOPSIS

.B  ./hsh
.I (no options included as of this writing (August 14, 2021))

.SH DESCRIPTION

simple_shell, is a custom implementation of a simple UNIX shell. A minimalistic approach was taken in its design and implementation to only provide the basic functions of a shell similar to the one designed by the pioneer of UNIX shells, Ken Thompson. Design, compilation, and testing was done on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

.SH OVERVIEW

Similar to other legendary command line interfaces, the simple_shell takes input from either the terminal or scripts and executes them as they appear. 


.SH INVOCATION

The GNU Compiler Collectiojn, gcc, is recommended for compiling simple_shell with extra flags as shown.  
.P
.RS
.B $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
.P
.RE
In interactive mode, the simple_shell works by taking user input on the terminal after pressing the enter key. Note that the prompt ('$') will appear and you will then be in interactive mode and able to enter commands followed by "enter." 
.P
.RS
.B $ ./hsh
.P
.RE
In non-interactive mode, users can specify shell scripts to be executed by simple_shell usually through the use of pipes '|'. 
.P
.RS
.B echo 'pwd' | ./hsh
